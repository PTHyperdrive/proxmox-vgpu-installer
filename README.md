# vGPU Proxmox Script
This is a little Bash script that configures a Proxmox 7 or 8 server to use Nvidia vGPU's. 
For further instructions see wvthoog's blogpost at https://wvthoog.nl/proxmox-7-vgpu-v3/

## WARNING !!!
- fastapi-dls is not working correctly with v18.x but working fine on v17.x, please consider this for extended use
- 17.6 & 18.1 is download only and only for natively support vGPU, lookup on NVIDIA for supported GPU ([v18.x](https://docs.nvidia.com/vgpu/18.0/product-support-matrix/index.html) & [v17.x](https://docs.nvidia.com/vgpu/17.0/product-support-matrix/index.html))
